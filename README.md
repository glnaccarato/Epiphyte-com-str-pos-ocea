**Abstract**

The occurrence of localized eutrophication events in small coastal communities of the Mediterranean threatens the functionality of surrounding seagrass ecosystems, necessitating the reliable identification of the onset and magnitude of these processes. Therefore, this study examined the suitability of epiphyte assemblages on Posidonia oceanica leaves as an indicator of anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, for the first time in meadows in the eastern Aegean Sea. Using a hierarchical sampling design, seagrass biometric and meadow parameters were studied at control (CS) and potentially disturbed (PDS) sites (n=3), in addition to epiphyte community structure in a depth of 5 m, during winter 2022. A total of 34 taxa were identified on the apical part of the leaves. PDS meadows, characterised using a modified Land Use Simplified Index (LUSI), exhibited decreased leaf length and shoot density, and increased epiphyte cover and biomass. Epiphyte assemblages shifted significantly, with clear differences observed in red coralline algae, filamentous brown algae, bryozoans, and annelids. Results highlighted water quality degradation from point sources, including a local sewage outlet, tourist, and agricultural activity, which strongly affected seagrass bed condition, due to substantial epiphyte cover and its direct (shading) and indirect (intensified grazing; physical leaf instability) effects. Furthermore, the study revealed that epiphyte communities, in combination with the LUSI, serve as accurate and cost-effective indicators of coastal water pollution. Regular monitoring could detect higher nutrient loading at an early stage and potentially prevent long-term meadow decline.
